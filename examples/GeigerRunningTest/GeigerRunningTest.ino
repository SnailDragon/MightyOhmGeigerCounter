/**
 * This example uses the "running" functions. These functions will find the measurements with a CPS 
 * based on the counts in the time period since the last measurement or the begin() function. This means
 * that if you have long waiting periods between each measurement the measurements returned will be based
 * on the average CPS during that time period. If you want to focus the measurement to a specific time frame,
 * consider using refreshSample() to reset the sample period and count or the "blocking" functions (example in GeigerBlockingTest.ino).
 * 
 * These "running" functions also have a built-in minimum sample period (5000 ms), meaning that they will not update the 
 * values they are returning until the period is long enough, helping with reading accuracy. This can cause the first few 
 * measurements after a begin() or refreshSample() to be inaccurate, if the time since the period start has not been long 
 * enough to replace the old values. If you want to set this minimum sample period manually, you can pass it as a second 
 * argument to begin() (example in GeigerMinimumSamplePeriod.ino).
