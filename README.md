### Mighty Ohm Geiger Counter Arduino Library 
##### By Tyler Nielsen 
---
An interrupt-based Arduino library for interfacing with the [Might Ohm Geiger Counter's](https://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/) "pulse" output. This library allows for the Geiger Counter to be used without the built-in serial output. 


CPS to uSv/hr conversions based on Mighty Ohm's [ATtyiny2313 AVR source code](https://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/source-code/) for the Geiger Sensor.
